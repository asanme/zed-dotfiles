# Zed Editor Dotfiles

This repository contains configuration files (dotfiles) for the Zed editor, this configuration aims to mimic Jetbrain's IDE keymaps, but only the primary ones that I use.

## Getting Started
---
**NOTE: To get this to work you must install the GNU Stow command.**

To use these dotfiles, follow the step below:

- **Clone the repository and apply the configuration:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:asanme/zed-dotfiles.git
   cd zed-dotfiles
   stow .
   ```
